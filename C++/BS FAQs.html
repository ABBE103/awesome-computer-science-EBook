<h2><a name="pronounce">
How do you pronounce "Bjarne Stroustrup?"</a></h2>
It can be difficult for non-Scandinavians.
The best suggestion I have heard yet was "start by saying it a few times
in Norwegian, then stuff a potato down your throat and do it again :-)"
Here is a
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/pronounciation.wav">wav file</a>.
<p>
For people who can't receive sound, here is a suggestion:
Both of my names are pronounced with two syllables: Bjar-ne
Strou-strup.
Neither the B nor the J in my first name are stressed and the NE
is rather weak so maybe Be-ar-neh or By-ar-ne would give an idea.
The first U in my second name really should have been a V making the
first syllable end far down the throat: Strov-strup.
The second U is a bit like the OO in OOP, but still short; maybe
Strov-stroop will give an idea.
</p><p>
Yes, this probably is the most frequently asked question :-)
</p><p>
P.S. My first name is Bjarne - not Bjorn (not a name),
Bjørn (a related but different name), nor Barney (an unrelated name).
My second name is Stroustrup - not Stroustroup, Stroustrop, Strustrup,
Strustrop, Strustroup, Straustrup, nor Straustroup (documents using each of
these misspellings can be found using google).
</p><p>



</p><hr>
<h2><a name="ask">
Can I ask you a question?</a></h2>
Certainly.
I try to answer my email.
However, please try to avoid asking a question that is answered in my
homepages.
Also, please don't rely on a prompt answer.
I get a <b>lot</b> of email.

<h2><a name="email">
Why don't you answer your email?</a></h2>
I do, but I get a lot of email.
I estimate that I reply to more than 95% of the (non spam) messages I receive.
However, sometimes I get overwhelmed.
Some messages are lost in my mailbox, some are delayed until I can find time,
some are delayed until I get around to answering a set of related messages
(this often happens to comments about potential errors in my books).
Unfortunately, longer and more thoughtful messages are more likely to get
delayed than simple ones that have simple answers.
<p>
Also, if you mail me, please try to make sure that I can reply to you.
I really hate it when I have written and sent a reply, just to find that the
return address is invalid or inaccessible. 
</p><p>
Two kinds of messages have a relatively high chance of getting lost: homework
questions and questions of the form "how do I use this proprietary library?".
I'm a bit sad about not answering the latter questions because often the
person asking doesn't understand that the DOS, Windows, or whatever interface
from C++ is not part of the C++ standard (and I cannot keep up with the huge
number of
<a href="http://www.trumphurst.com/cpplibs1.html">C++ libraries</a>).
If you fail to receive an answer,
please consider if your question was of one of these kinds.
</p><p>
Also, unless you give your name, I am now likely to delete the message unread.
This is a new policy.
I was never a great fan of pseudonyms,
but I find that the chance of a polite
technical conversation with the kind of person who thinks it cool to hide behind a name like
suuupergeeek or coolGuy3 is getting too low for me to bother trying.
</p><p>

</p><hr>
<h2><a name="looks">Why don't you make your website look modern?</a></h2>
I'm a "contents provider" not a website designer.
I can use my time to improve the contents or the looks, but not both.
<p>
What looks "cool and modern" to someone is often considered bad
taste by someone else, and fashions change fast.
Also,
very plain html downloads and displays faster than anything else, and many
people still suffer from slow web connections.
</p><p>

</p><hr>
<h2><a name="impostor">Is "bjarne" an impostor?</a></h2>
Probably not.
Most of the newsgroup postings, interviews, etc. claiming to come from me
do come from me.
The obvious exception is the infamous <a href="#IEEE">IEEE "interview"</a>,
which I find rather unfunny.
I have been known to post to newsgroups from my gmail account where my user-id is "Bjarne";
somehow, that seems to confuse some people.
If in doubt, consider the style and contents of the suspect message, check for other
postings in the forum, or ask.
<p>

</p><hr>
<h2><a name="class">What is so great about classes?</a></h2>
<p>
Classes are there to help you organize your code and to reason about your programs.
You could roughly equivalently say that classes are there to help you avoid making mistakes
and to help you find bugs after you do make a mistake.
In this way, classes significantly helps maintenance.
</p><p>
A class is the representation of an idea, a concept, in the code. An object of a class represents
a particular example of the idea in the code. Without classes, a reader of the code would have
to guess about the relationships among data items and functions - classes make such relationships
explicit and "understood" by compilers. With classes, more of the high-level structure of your
program is reflected in the code, not just in the comments.
</p><p>
A well-designed class presents a clean and simple interface to its users, hiding its
representation and saving its users from having to know about that representation.
If the representation shouldn't be hidden - say, because users should be able to change
any data member any way they like - you can think of that class as "just a plain old data structure";
for example:
</p><pre>	struct Pair {
      		Pair(const string&amp; n, const string&amp; v) : name(n), value(v) { }
      		string name, value;
	};
</pre>
Note that even data structures can benefit from auxiliary functions, such as constructors.
<p>
When designing a class, it is often useful to consider what's true for every object of the
class and at all times. Such a property is called an invariant. For example, the invariant
of a vector could be that its representation consists of a pointer to a number of elements
and that number of elements is stored in an integer. It is the job of every constructor to
establish the class invariant, so that every member function can rely on it.
Every member function must leave the invariant valid upon exit.
This kind of thinking is particularly useful for classes that manage resource,
such as locks, sockets, and files. For example, a file handle class will have the invariant
that it holds a pointer to an open file. The file handle constructor opens the file.
Destructors free resources acquired by constructors. For example, the destructor for
a file handle closes the file opened by the constructor:
</p><pre>	class File_handle {
	public:
		File_handle(const char* n, const char* rw)
			{ f = fopen(n,rw); if (f==0) throw Open_failure(n); }
		~File_handle() { fclose(f); } // destructor
		// ...
	private:
		FILE* f;
	};
</pre>
If you haven't programmed with classes, you will find parts of this explanation obscure and
you'll underestimate the usefulness of classes. Look for examples. Like all good textbooks,
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">TC++PL</a> has lots of examples;
for example, see
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/tour2.pdf">A Tour of the Standard Library</a>.
Most modern C++ libraries consist (among other things) of classes and a library tutorial
is one of the best places to look for examples of useful classes.
<p>



</p><hr>
<h2><a name="oop">What is "OOP" and what's so great about it?</a></h2>
<p>
There are lots of definitions of "object oriented", "object-oriented programming",
and "object-oriented programming languages". For a longish explanation of what
I think of as "object oriented", read
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/oopsla.pdf">Why C++ isn't just an object-oriented programming language</a>.
That said, object-oriented programming is a style of programming originating with
Simula (about 40 years ago!) relying of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
In the context of C++ (and many other languages with their roots in Simula),
it means programming using class hierarchies and virtual functions to allow
manipulation of objects of a variety of types through well-defined interfaces
and to allow a program to be extended incrementally through derivation.
</p><p>
See <a href="#class">What's so great about classes?</a>
for an idea about what great
about "plain classes". The point about arranging classes into a class hierarchy
is to express hierarchical relationships among classes and use those relationships to simplify code.
</p><p>
To really understand OOP, look for some examples. For example, you might have
two (or more) device drivers with a common interface:
</p><pre>	class Driver {	// common driver interface
	public:
		virtual int read(char* p, int n) = 0;	// read max n characters from device to p
							// return the number of characters read
		virtual bool reset() = 0;	// reset device
		virtual Status check() = 0;	// read status
	};
</pre>
This Driver is simply an interface.
It is defined with no data members and a set of pure virtual functions.
A Driver can be used through this interface and many different kinds of drivers
can implement this interface:
<pre>	class Driver1 : public Driver { // a driver
	public:
		Driver1(Register);	// constructor
		int read(char*, int n);	
		bool reset();
		Status check();
	private:
		// implementation details, incl. representation
	};

	class Driver2 : public Driver { // another driver
	public:
		Driver2(Register);
		int read(char*, int n);	
		bool reset();
		Status check();
	private:
		// implementation details, incl., representation
	};
</pre>
Note that these drivers hold data (state) and objects of them can be created.
They implement the functions defined in Driver. We can imagine a driver being used like this:
<pre>	void f(Driver&amp; d)	// use driver
	{
		Status old_status = d.check();	
		// ...
		d.reset();
		char buf[512];
		int x = d.read(buf,512);
		// ...
	}
</pre>
The key point here is that f() doesn't need to know which kind of driver it uses;
all it needs to know is that it is passed a Driver;
that is, an interface to many different kinds of drivers.
We could invoke f() like this:
<pre>	void g()
	{
		Driver1 d1(Register(0xf00));	// create a Driver1 for device
						// with device register at address 0xf00

		Driver2 d2(Register(0xa00));	// create a Driver2 for device
						// with device register at address 0xa00
		// ...
		int dev;
		cin &gt;&gt; dev;

		if  (dev==1) 
			f(d1);	// use d1
		else
			f(d2);	// use d2
		// ...
	}
</pre>
Note that when f() uses a Driver the right kind of operations are implicitly chosen at run time.
For example, when f() is passed d1, d.read() uses Driver1::read(), whereas when f() is passed d2,
d.read() uses Driver2::read(). This is sometimes called run-time dispatch or dynamic dispatch.
In this case there is no way that f() could know the kind of device it is called with because
we choose it based on an input.
<p>
Please note that object-oriented programming is not a panacea. "OOP" does not simply mean "good"
- if there are no inherent hierarchical relationships among the fundamental concepts in your problem
then no amount of hierarchy and virtual functions will improve your code. The strength of OOP
is that there are many problems that can be usefully expressed using class hierarchies - the main
weakness of OOP is that too many people try to force too many problems into a hierarchical mould.
Not every program should be object-oriented. As alternatives, consider
<a href="#class">plain classes</a>,
<a href="#generic">generic programming</a>,
and free-standing functions (as in math, C, and Fortran).
</p><p>


</p><hr>
<h2><a name="generic">What is "generic programming" and what's so great about it?</a></h2>
<p>
Generic programming is programming based on parameterization:
You can parameterize a type with another
(such as a vector with its element types) and an algorithm with another
(such as a sort function with
a comparison function). The aim of generic programming is to generalize a useful algorithm or data
structure to its most general and useful form. For example, a vector of integers is fine and so is
a function that finds the largest value in a vector of integers. However, a generic solution that
provides a vector of any type the user cares to use and a function that finds the largest value in
any vector is better still:
</p><pre>	vector&lt;string&gt;::iterator p = find(vs.begin(), vs.end(), "Grail");

	vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator q = find(vi.begin(), vi.end(), 42);
</pre>
These examples are from the STL (the containers and algorithms part of the ISO C++ standard library);
for a brief introduction, see
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/tour2.pdf">A Tour of the Standard Library</a> from
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">TC++PL</a>.
<p>
Generic programming is in some ways more flexible than object-oriented programming.
In particular, it does not depend on hierarchies.
For example, there is no hierarchical
relationship between an int and a string.
Generic programming is generally more structured than OOP;
in fact, a common term used to describe generic programming is "parametric polymorphism",
with "ad hoc polymorphism"
being the corresponding term for object-oriented programming.
In the context of C++, generic programming
resolves all names at compile time; it does not involve dynamic (run-time) dispatch.
This has led generic programming to become dominant in areas where run-time performance is important.
</p><p>
Please note that generic programming is not a panacea.
There are many parts of a program that need no parameterization and many examples
where run-time dispatch (OOP) is needed.

That is, why does C++ support operations that can be used to violate the rules of static
(compile-time) type safety?
<ul>
<li> to access hardware directly
	(e.g. to treat an integer as a pointer to (address of) a device register)
</li><li> to achieve optimal run-time and space performance
	(e.g. unchecked access to elements of an array and unchecked access to
	an object through a pointer)
</li><li> to be compatible with C
</li></ul>
That said, it is a good idea to avoid unsafe code like the plague whenever you don't actually need
one of those three features:
<ul>
<li>	don't use casts
</li><li>	keep arrays out of interfaces (hide them in the innards of high-performance functions
	and classes where they are needed and write the rest of the program using proper
	strings, vectors, etc.)
</li><li>	avoid void* (keep them inside low-level functions and data structures if
	you really need them and present type safe interfaces, usually templates, to your users)
</li><li>	avoid unions
</li><li>	if you have any doubts about the validity of a pointer, use a smart pointer instead,
</li><li>	don't use "naked" news and deletes (use containers, resource handles, etc., instead)
</li><li>	don't use ...-style variadic functions ("printf style")
</li><li>	Avoid <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/bs_faq2.html#macro">macros</a> excpt for include guards
</li></ul>
Almost all C++ code can follow these simple rules.
Please don't be confused by the fact that you cannot follow these rules if you write C code or
C-style code in C++.

<h2><a name="best-book">What is the best book to learn C++ from?</a></h2>
There is no one book that is best for every person.
There couldn't be one.
People are too different in the way they learn, in what they
already know, in what they need, in what they want, and in what kind of
effort
they are willing to make.
There are quite a few excellent books on C++.
Have a look at
<a href="http://www.accu.org/">the ACCU (The Association of C and C++ Users) site</a>.
This is one of the best sites for book recommendations by experienced
programmers who are not afraid to speak their mind (booksellers tend to
give rosy reviews, and reviews of the form "This book is perfect,
I love it, I have read almost three chapters, and can't wait to read
more" are worse than useless - why anyone would take advice on how to learn
C++ from someone who completely lacks C++ experience beats me).
The ACCU rates books for level of experience required and overall quality.
<p>
For people who haven't programmed before or come from another language and want a
relatively gentle introduction to modern C++, consider
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/programming.html">Programming: Principles and Practice using C++</a>.
This is the book I wrote for a freshman (1st year university students) programming class
and it has benefitted from three years of classroom use.
</p><p>
For people who are programmers and willing to learn new concepts
and techniques from a classical textbook, I recommend
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html"> The C++ Programming Language (3rd edition)</a>.
See
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/about_3rd.html">a note about the structure, contents, and aims
of "The C++ Programming Language (3rd edition)"</a>:
The book is aimed at programmers with some experience and a wish to master C++.
It is not aimed at non-programmers trying to learn their first programming language
or casual programmers trying to gain a superficial understanding of C++ as fast
as possible.
Consequently, this book focuses on concepts and techniques and goes to some pain to
be complete and precise.
It describes "pure C++," that is, the language independently of
any particular software development environment or foundation
library (except the standard library, of course).
</p><p>
If you want to know why C++ is the way it is, have a look at
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/dne.html"> The Design and Evolution of C++</a>
(D&amp;E). Understanding the design criteria and constraints
helps writing better programs.
</p><p>



</p><hr>
<h2><a name="How-long">How long does it take to learn C++?</a></h2>
That depends on what you mean by "learning."
If you are a C programmer you can learn enough C++ to make you more
effective at C-style programming in a day.
<p>
At <a href="http://www.cs.tamu.edu/">TAMU</a>,
we use <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/programming.html">Programming: Principles and Practice using C++</a>
to get freshmen (1st year students) through the fundamentals of C++ and the
programming techniques it support (notably
<a href="#oop">object-oriented programming</a> and
<a href="#generic">generic programming</a>)
in a semester.
</p><p>
On the other hand, if you want to be fully comfortable with all the
major C++ language constructs, with data abstraction, Object-Oriented
programming, generic programming, Object-Oriented design, etc., you can
easily spend a year or two - if you aren't already acquainted with
those techniques (say, from Java or C#).
</p><p>
Is that then the time it takes to learn C++?
Maybe, but then again, that is the timescale we have to consider to
become better designers and programmers. If a dramatic change of the
way
we work and think about building systems isn't our aim, then
why bother to learn a new language?
Compared to the time required to learn to play the piano well or to
become fluent in a foreign (natural) language, learning a new and
different programming language and programming style is easy.
</p><p>
For more observations about learning C++ see
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/dne.html"> D&amp;E</a> or
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/learn.html">a note from comp.lang.c++</a>
that I wrote some time ago.
</p><p>


</p><hr>
<h2><a name="prerequisite">
Knowing C is a prerequisite for learning C++, right?</a></h2>
Wrong. The common subset of C and C++ is easier to learn than C.
There will be less type errors to catch manually (the C++ type
system is stricter and more expressive), fewer tricks
to learn (C++ allows you to express more things without
circumlocution),
and better libraries available.
The best initial subset of C++ to learn is not "all of C".
<p>
See
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/new_learning.pdf">Learning Standard C++ as a New Language</a>
for a discussion of the choice of C++ constructs, techniques, and libraries
for early learning.
For an example of books that takes that approach systematically, see
Stroustrup: <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/programming.html">Programming: Principles and Practice using C++</a> and
Koenig&amp;Moo: "Accelerated C++" from Addison Wesley's
<a href="http://www.awl.com/cseng/series/indepth/index.shtml">C++ In Depth</a> series.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="learn-pure">
Should I learn a pure OO language before C++ to become a real OO programmer?</a></h2>
No. Learning something new is almost always a good idea.
However, each language is different and has it's own styles and quirks.
Code written in some supposedly "pure" OO style modeled on some other language (quirks and all)
is often sub-optimal and frustrating when too literally transcribed into C++.
Also, "writing <b>just</b> pure Object-oriented code" is not one of my ideals; see my OOPSLA keynote
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/oopsla.pdf">
Why C++ isn't just an Object-Oriented Programming Language</a>.
If you want to become a good C++ programmer and don't have a few months
to spare, concentrate on C++ and the concepts it embodies.
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="how-to-start">How do I start learning C++?</a></h2>
Naturally,
that strongly depends on what you already know and your reasons for
learning C++.
If you are a novice at programming, I strongly recommend that you find 
an experienced programmer to help you.
Otherwise, the inevitable mistakes about language concepts and practical
problems with the implementation you use can magnify into serious frustrations.
<p>
You'll need a textbook for learning C++.
This is the case even when your implementation comes with ample on-line
documentation.
The reason is that 
language and library documentation together with sample code are not good
teachers of concepts.
Typically such sources are silent about why things are the way they are and
what benefits you can expect (and which you shouldn't expect) from a technique.
Focus on concepts and techniques rather than language-technical details.
</p><p>
When choosing a book, look for one that presents Standard C++ and use the
standard library facilities in an integrated manner from the start.
For example, reading a string from input should look something like
</p><pre>	string s;	// Standard C++ style
	cin &gt;&gt; s;
</pre>
and not like this
<pre>	char s[MAX];	/* Standard C style */
	scanf("%s",s);
</pre>
Look for book recommendations from programmers with solid C++ experience.
<p>
I recommend
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/programming.html">Programming: Principles and Practice using C++</a>,
but remember that
<a href="#best-book">no one book is the best for everyone</a>.
Have a look at the
<a href="http://www.accu.org/">book reviews</a>
on the ACCU (The Association of C and C++ Users) site.
</p><p>
Aim to write idiomatic C++: avoid simply writing code in the style of your
previous language using C++ syntax; there is little to be gained from
simply changing syntax.
</p><p>


</p><hr>
<h2><a name="homework">Will you help me with my homework?</a></h2>
No. Sorry. I don't do (other people's) homework.
I get too many requests for help with homework and help with finding
bugs in student programs to be able to find the time.
Anyway, having a distant expert fix your programs is not the best way to learn.
Try finding a local person with C++ experience that you can ask for
guidance.
A good mentor is the best help a student can have; maybe that's why they
are not easy to find.
<p>
Also, no, I will not suggest "a good project for a student to work on".
My experience is that learning enough about a student and
his/her course to know what level of difficulty is required and what kind of
project is of interest takes time.
To think of a good project is then non-trivial,
and to explain exactly what the project is and how to approach it can take
several messages and several hours. I just don't have that kind of time.
Remember, these request come at least weekly. Finally, some students seem
to have the idea that if I suggest a project, I am morally obliged to
provide quite detailed help in its completion.
</p><p>
Ideas: Look at the exercises in
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">TC++PL3</a>
or other good textbooks. Many of those exercises are designed to keep a student
busy for several days, and reading those exercises can inspire an enterprising
student to so something similar.
Or look at the non-computer-science part of your world: Maybe a biology project
could use support for a new measurement device or a friend studying history
could use an improved database interface. Many of the best projects and the
best uses of computers are outside traditional computer science.

<h2><a name="improve-my-C++-programs">
What's the best way to improve my C++ programs?</a></h2>
I couldn't say. That depends on how you use it.
Most people underestimate abstract classes and templates.
Conversely, most people seriously overuse casts and macros.
Have a look at one of my
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/papers.html">papers</a> or
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/books.html">books</a> for ideas.
One way of thinking of abstract classes and templates is as
interfaces that allow a more clean and logical presentation
of services than is easy to provide through functions or
single-rooted class hierarchies.
See my
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/bs_faq2.html">Style and techniques FAQ</a> for some specific examples and ideas.

<h2><a name="which-programming-language">
Does it matter which programming language I use?</a></h2>
Yes, but don't expect miracles.
Some people seem to believe that a programming language can or at least
should
solve most of their problems with system building.
They are condemned to search forever for the perfect programming
language
and become repeatedly disappointed.
Others dismiss programming languages as unimportant "implementation
details"
and put their money into development processes and design methods.
They are condemned to program in COBOL, C, and proprietary design
languages
forever.
A good language - such as C++ - can do a lot for a designer and a
programmer,
as long as its strengths and limitations are clearly understood and
respected.
<p>


</p><hr>
<h2><a name="spoil-C++">
Did the ANSI/ISO standards committee spoil C++?</a></h2>
No. They/we did a good job.
You can quibble with details (and I do, sometimes loudly), but I'm happy with the
language and the
new standard library.
ISO C++ is a better and more coherent language than earlier versions of
C++.
You can write much more elegant and maintainable C++ programs today
than was
possible when the standards process started.
The new standard library is also a real boon.
The provision of strings, lists, vectors, maps, and basic algorithms
for
such fundamental types makes a major difference to the way one can
approach
C++.

<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html"> The C++ Programming Language (3rd edition)</a>

<h2><a name="When-standard">When will we have a C++ standard?</a></h2>
We have one! The final technical vote took place
November 14, 1997, about 10:30am.
See
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/iso_release.html">a press release from the ISO C++ standards
committee</a>.
After the technical vote, the standard was ratified in 1998 by a 22-0 national vote.
The standard is ISO/IEC 14882.
A minor revision was issued in 2004; see my <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++.html">C++ page</a>.
<p>
This is the language and standard library described in
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">The C++ Programming Language (3rd edition)</a>.
The C++ compiler and library suppliers are already shipping
implementations that are quite close to the draft standard.
</p><p>
The first draft of the next standard,
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++0xFAQ.html">C++0x</a>,
is in public review and the final vote is expected in 2010.

</p><p>

</p><p>


</p><hr>
<h2><a name="remove-from-C++">
Are there any features you'd like to remove from C++?</a></h2>
Not really.
People who ask this kind of question usually think of one of the major
features such as multiple inheritance,
exceptions, templates, or run-time type identification.
C++ would be incomplete without those.
I have reviewed their design over the years, and together with the
standards
committee I have improved some of their details,
but none could be removed without doing damage.
<p>
Most of the features I dislike from a language-design perspective
(e.g., the declarator syntax and array decay) are part
of the C subset of C++ and couldn't be removed without doing harm to
programmers working under real-world conditions.
C++'s C compatibility was a key language design decision rather than a
marketing gimmick.
Compatibility has been difficult to achieve and maintain,
but real benefits to real programmers resulted, and still result today.
By now, C++ has features that allow a programmer to refrain from using
the most troublesome C features. For example, standard library
containers
such as vector, list, map, and string can be used to avoid most tricky
low-level pointer manipulation.
</p><p>



</p><hr>
<h2><a name="C++03">
What is the difference between C++98 and C++03?</a></h2>
From a programmer's view there is none.
The C++03 revision of the standard was a bug fix release for implementers to ensure greater
consistency and portability.
In particular, tutorial and reference material describing C++98 and C++03 can be used interchangeably
by all except compiler writers and standards gurus.
<p>
Personally, I tend not to use the term "C++03" because it is easily confused with "C++0x"
and could give the impression that C++98 is outdated.



</p><hr>
<h2><a name="When-next-standard">
What will C++0x look like?</a></h2>
See my <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++0xFAQ.html">C++0x FAQ</a>.
The aim is for the 'x' in C++0x to become '9': C++09, rather than (say) C++0xA (hexadecimal :-).
<p>
Note that the C++ language will remain stable because
compatibility is always a major concern.
The committee tries hard not to break your (standard conforming) code.
</p><p>
I briefly presented some of my ideas at <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++0x_panel.pdf">a panel at SD2001w</a>

<h2><a name="ARM">
When will we have a new ARM?</a></h2>
Ellis&amp;Stroustrup:
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/arm.html">The Annotated C++ Reference Manual</a> colloquially known
as "The ARM" was written in 1989 and was the base of the C++ standards effort.
It is by now quite old and does not describe Standard C++.
<p>
For a variety of reasons, the planned replacement ("ARM++") describing ISO Standard C++ was
never written.
As the work on C++0x is now proceeding, it is too late for an ARM++ based on ISO C++ 1998.
My guess is that I won't find the time to write a new ARM.
A 4th edition of
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">TC++PL</a>
and a 2nd edition of
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/programming.html">Programming: Principles and Practice using C++</a>
to match C++0x (when C++0x become the dominant C++) are likely to be more important.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="4th">
When will you publish a 4th edition of "The C++ Programming Language"?</a></h2>
Not soon. 
The definition of C++ and the fundamental techniques that it supports
are unlikely to change significantly before
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++0xFAQ.html">C++0x</a>
becomes dominant.
When I write, I aim for a long "shelf life" and
<a href="#When-next-standard">the ISO C++ standard</a>
ensures basic stability.
In this context, it is important that 
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">The C++ Programming Language (3rd Edition)</a> describes
Standard C++, its standard library, and the techniques they support rather
than some particular implementation and some proprietary library.
What is in the curent ISO C++ standard and described in my 3rd edition will remain valid C++
for many years to come - even after the revised standard appears.
<p>
Confusingly, the German translation of the "Special Edition" is referred to as the 4th edition.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="SE">
Should I buy the "Special Edition" of "The C++ Programming Language"?</a></h2>
Sure! Buy it early and often :-)
<p>
Seriously, the difference between the current printings of the special
edition and the 3rd edition is just the hard
cover (and the price difference implied by that stronger cover).
</p><p>
If I were a C++ programmer who hadn't read
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">The C++ Programming Language (3rd Edition)</a>,
I'd buy and read either the 3rd edition or the special edition.
If I used my textbooks and references heavily, I'd choose the hard cover.
The cover on the 3rd is the best soft cover available, but it doesn't equal
the special edition's hard cover.
</p><p>
If I already had the 3rd edition, I'd buy the SE if my current
copy were fraying or if my copy were an early printing
(the 3rd now has about 30 printings and SE about 20).
</p><p>
Compared to the first printing, the special edition and the most recent
printings of the 3rd edition have 1,000+ corrections and clarifications.
As a heavy C++ user, I find that significant. There are also the two new
appendices
(just over 100 pages; available for download: <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd_loc0.html">Locales</a>
and
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd_safe0.html">Standard-Library Exception Safety</a>).
</p><p>
Existing material has not moved around so page numbers can be used to refer
to material in old printings, new printings of the 3rd edition, and in the
SE.
</p><p>
The SE also has an improved index.

<h2><a name="Java">
Is Java the language you would
have designed if you didn't have to be compatible with C?</a></h2>
No. Java isn't even close.
If people insist on comparing C++ and Java - as they seem to do -
I suggest they read
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/dne.html"> The Design and Evolution of C++</a>
(D&amp;E) to see why C++ is the way it is,
and consider both languages in the light of the design criteria
I set for C++. Those criteria will obviously differ from the criteria
of Sun's Java team.
Despite the syntactic similarities, C++ and Java are very different
languages.
In many ways, Java seems closer to Smalltalk than to C++.
<p>
Much of the relative simplicity of Java is - like for most new
languages -
partly an illusion and partly a function of its incompleteness.
As time passes, Java will grow
significantly in size and complexity. It will double or triple in size
and grow implementation-dependent extensions or libraries.
That is the way every commercially
successful language has developed. Just look at any language you
consider successful on a large scale. I know of no exceptions,
and there are good reasons for this phenomenon.
[I wrote this before 2000; now see <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/05/30/1942259&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=108&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=156">a preview of Java 1.5</a>.]
</p><p>
I have commented (negatively) about Java hype and ascribed much of Java's success to marketing.
For example, see <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/hopl-almost-final.pdf">my HOPL-3 paper</a>.
Today (2010), the claims made about Java are more reality based and less gratuitously derogative about alternatives.
This was not always so. For example, compare the <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/1995_Java_whitepaper.pdf">original 1995 Java white paper</a>
with the versions you find on the web (sometimes labelled "the original 
Java whitepaper"); page 69 would be a good place to start.
</p><p>
Java isn't platform independent; it is a platform.
Like Windows, it is a proprietary commercial platform.
That is, you can write programs for Windows/Intel or Java/JVM, and in
each
case you are writing code for a platform owned by a single corporation
and tweaked for the commercial benefit of that corporation.
It has been pointed out that you can write programs in any language for
the JVM and associated operating systems facilities. However, the JVM,
etc.,
are heavily biased in favor of Java. It is nowhere near being a general
reasonably language-neutral VM/OS.
</p><p>
Personally, I'll stick to reasonably portable C++ for most of the kind
of work I think most about and use a variety of languages for the rest.

<h2><a name="Csharp">
What do you think of C#?</a></h2>
I have no comments on C# as a language.
It will take a lot to persuade me that the world needs yet another
proprietary language.
It will be especially hard to persuade me that it needs a language that is
closely integrated with a specific proprietary operating system.
<p>
If you want to write exclusively for the .Net platform, C# isn't the worst alternative,
but remember that C++ is a strongly supported - though less strongly hyped - alternative
on that platform.

<h2><a name="CppCLI">
What do you think of C++/CLI?</a></h2>
C++/CLI is a set of extensions to ISO C++ that provides an extremely complete "binding" of C++
to Microsoft's CLI (Common Language Infrastructure).
It has been standardized by ECMA (ECMA-372). I am happy that it makes every feature of the CLI
easily accessible from C++ and happy that C++/CLI is a far better language than its predecessor
"Managed C++".
However, I am less happy that C++/CLI achieves its goals by essentially augmenting C++ with
a separate language feature for each feature of CLI
(interfaces, properties, generics, pointers, inheritance, enumerations, and much, much more).
This will be a major source of confusion (whatever anyone does or says).
The wealth of new language facilities in C++/CLI compared to ISO Standard C++ tempts programmers
to write non-portable code that (often invisibly) become intimately tied to Microsoft Windows.
<p>
The CLI provides a set of interfaces (to system facilities) that are very different from traditional
interfaces to operating system facilities and applications.
In particular, these interfaces have semantics that
cannot be completely or conveniently expressed in conventional programming languages.
One way of describing CLI is as a (partial) "platform" or "virtual machine". It consists of a
large set of language features (inheritance, methods, loop constructs, callback mechanisms, etc.),
supporting a large set of foundation libraries (the BCL), plus an elaborate system of metadata.
The CLI is sometimes
described as "language neutral". However, a language that doesn't accept a large subset of
these facilities cannot use even basic .Net facilities
(or future Microsoft Windows facilities, assuming that Microsoft's plans don't change)
and a language that cannot express <b>all</b> of these
features cannot be used for the implementation of resources meant to be usable by other languages.
Thus, CLI is "language neutral" only in the sense that every language must support all of the CLI
features to be "first-class" on .Net.
</p><p>
I prefer a binding to be a few primitives, expressible as simple function calls and simple
data structures in any language, possibly encapsulated in language-specific libraries.
For the CLI, this can at best be done for consumers of CLI facilities only. A language
used to produce CLI modules must be able to express all of the CLI facilities, including
the metadata.
Only a language that can do that can be considered a systems programming language on .Net. 
Thus, the Microsoft C++ team concluded that only build-in language facilities
are acceptable to their customers.
Their design reflects a view that accepts absolutely no restrictions on what part of CLI can be
expressed in C++ with the C++/CLI extensions,
absolutely no verbosity compared to other languages when using CLI facilities,
and absolutely no overheads compared to other languages.
They aim at preserving C++ as the dominant systems programming language for Windows.
</p><p>
As ever,
<a href="#portability">I place a heavy emphasis on portability</a> and
recommend people to design applications so that access to system-specific facilities are through
well-defined interfaces specified in ISO C++ (e.g., not to use C++/CLI directly).
On Windows, this will sometimes be inconvenient compared with using C++/CLI
facilities directly, but it's the only way to gain portability and a degree of vendor independence.
Obviously, that arms-length approach to the CLI cannot be maintained if the purpose of a piece of
code is to provide a CLI interface to be consumed by other code.
Please note that I recognize the need for system-specific extensions and that Microsoft is not
the only C++ vendor with such extensions, I just strongly prefer to deal with such extensions
through a "thin interface" specified in ISO standard C++.
</p><p>
How to deal with system-specific extensions is inherently a difficult question.
The Microsoft C++ team, especially Herb Sutter, has kept up an active dialog with (other) members
of the ISO C++ standards committee so that the relationship between ISO C++ and its superset C++/CLI
will eventually be worked out.
We have a long record of constructive joint work in the ISO C++ committee.
Also, to minimize confusion between ISO C++ and the C++/CLI extensions, Microsoft is now revising
their Visual C++ documentation to try to clearly distinguish C++/CLI from ISO C++
(plain unqualified C++ means ISO C++).
I hope others will follow that lead.
</p><p>
On the difficult and controversial question of what the CLI binding/extensions to C++ is to be called,
I prefer C++/CLI as a shorthand for "The CLI extensions to ISO C++".
Keeping C++ as part of the name reminds people what is the base language and will
help keep C++ a proper subset of C++ with the C++/CLI extensions.
The <a href="http://public.research.att.com/%7Ebs/bs_faq.html#merge">C/C++ compatibility problems</a>
demonstrate how important it is to keep that subset property.

<h2><a name="portability">
Why are you so keen on portability?</a></h2>
Successful software is long-lived; life-spans of decades are not uncommon.
A good application/program often outlives the hardware it was designed for,
the operating system it was written for, the data base system it initially used, etc.
Often, a good piece of software outlives the companies that supplied the basic technologies
used to build it.
<p>
Often a successful application/program have customers/users who prefer a variety of platforms.
The set of desirable platforms change as the user population changes. Being tied to a single
platform or single vendor, limits the application/program's potential use.
</p><p>
Obviously, complete platform independence is incompatible with the ability to use all platform
specific facilities. However, you can often approximate platform independence for an application
by accessing platform facilities through a "thin interface" representing the application's view
of its environment as a library.

<h2><a name="Ada">

an over-enthusiastic or malicious Ada devotee.
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="compare">
Would you compare C++ to "some language"?</a></h2>
No, sorry, I won't.
You can find the reason in the introductory notes of
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/dne.html">The Design and Evolution of C++</a>:
<p>
"Several reviewers asked me to compare C++ to other languages.
This I have decided against doing.
Thereby, I have reaffirmed a long-standing and strongly held view:
Language comparisons are rarely meaningful and even less often fair.
A good comparison of major programming languages requires
more effort than most people are willing to spend,
experience in a wide range of application areas,
a rigid maintenance of a detached and impartial point of view,
and a sense of fairness.
I do not have the time, and as the designer of C++, my impartiality
would never be fully credible.
</p><p>
I also worry about a phenomenon I have repeatedly observed in
honest attempts at language comparisons.
The authors try hard to be impartial, but are hopelessly biased by
focusing on a single application, a single style of programming, or
a single culture among programmers.
Worse, when one language is significantly better known than others,
a subtle shift in perspective occurs: Flaws in the well-known language
are deemed minor and simple workarounds are presented, whereas similar
flaws in other languages are deemed fundamental.
Often, the workarounds commonly used in the
less-well-known languages are simply unknown to the people doing the
comparison
or deemed unsatisfactory because they would be unworkable in the more
familiar
language.
</p><p>
Similarly, information about the well-known language tends to be
completely
up-to-date, whereas for the less-known language, the authors rely on
several-year-old information.
For languages that are worth comparing, a comparison of language X as
defined
three years ago vs. language Y as it appears in the latest experimental
implementation is neither fair nor informative.
Thus, I restrict my comments about languages other than C++ to
<a href="#advanced">generalities</a>
and to very specific comments."
</p><p>
That said, I consider C++ the best choice in programming language for a
wide
variety of people and applications.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="Others-do-compare">
Others do compare their languages to C++; doesn't that annoy you?</a></h2>
It does when it is done incompetently or for commercial gain.
The most widely circulated comparisons tend to be
those written by proponents of some language, Z, to prove that Z is
better
that other languages.
Given its wide use, C++ is often top of the list of languages
that the proponents of Z wants to prove inferior.
Often, such papers are "published" or distributed by a company that
sells Z as part of a marketing campaign.
Surprisingly, many seem to take an unreviewed paper written by people
working for a company selling Z "proving" that Z is best seriously.
One problem is that there are always grains of truth in such
comparisons.
After all, no language is better than every other in all possible ways.
C++ certainly isn't perfect,
but selective truth can be most seductive and occasionally completely
misleading.
<p>
When looking at a language comparison consider who wrote it,
consider carefully if the descriptions are factual and fair,
and also if the comparison criteria are themselves fair for all
languages considered.
This is not easy.
</p><p>


</p><hr>
<h2><a name="diatribes">
You won't compare C++ to other languages, but you write diatribes about C++?</a></h2>
I don't write diatribes (that's a hostile characterization of some
text), but
I do  consider it reasonable - possibly even a duty - for someone who
designed a
language to explain its virtues and defend it against hostile
characterizations.
See
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/papers.html">my publications list</a>.
In paticular, see my extensive and peer reviewed papers for the
ACM History of Programming Conference:

</li></ul>
Often, I also point out the limitations of C++ and the fundamental
assumptions
of the design of C++ (for example, see <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/dne.html">D&amp;E</a>).
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="C-is-better">
C is better than C++ for small projects, right?</a></h2>
Not in my opinion. I never saw a project for which C was better than
C++ for any reason but the lack of a good C++ compiler.
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="C-is-subset">
Is C a subset of C++?</a></h2>
In the strict mathematical sense, C isn't a subset of C++.
There are programs that are valid C but not valid C++ and even
a few ways of writing code that has a different meaning in C and C++.
However, C++ supports every programming technique supported by C.
Every C program can be written in essentially the same
way in C++ with the same run-time and space efficiency.
It is not uncommon to be able to convert tens of thousands of lines
of ANSI C to C-style C++ in a few hours.
Thus, C++ is as much a superset of ANSI C as ANSI C is a superset
of K&amp;R C and much as ISO C++ is a superset of C++ as it existed in 1985.
<p>
Well written C tends to be legal C++ also. For example, every example
in Kernighan &amp; Ritchie: "The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)" is
also a C++ program.
</p><p>
Examples of C/C++ compatibility problems:
</p><pre>	int main()
	{
		double sq2 = sqrt(2);   /* Not C++: call undeclared function */
		int s = sizeof('a');    /* silent difference: 1 in C++ sizeof(int) in C */
	}
</pre>
Calling an undeclared function is poor style in C and illegal in C++.
So is passing arguments to a function using a declaration that doesn't list
argument types:
<pre>	void f();	/* argument types not mentioned */

	void g()
	{
		f(2);	/* poor style C. Not C++ */
	}
</pre>
In C, a void* can be implicitly converted to any pointer type, and free-store
allocation is typically done using malloc() which has no way of checking
if "enough" memory is requested:
<pre>	void* malloc(size_t);

	void f(int n)
	{
		int* p = malloc(n*sizeof(char));  /* not C++. In C++, allocate using `new' */
		char c;
		void* pv = &amp;c;
		int* pi = pv;   /* implicit conversion of void* to int*. Not in C++ */
	}
</pre>
Note the potential alignment error caused by the implicit conversion
of the void* to a int*.
See
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/bs_faq2.html#void-ptr">the C++ alternative to void* and malloc()</a>.
<p>
When converting from C to C++, beware that C++ has more keywords than C:
</p><pre>	int class = 2;    /* ok in C. Syntax error in C++ */
	int virtual = 3;  /* ok in C. Syntax error in C++ */
</pre>
Except for a few examples such as the ones shown above
(and listed in detail in the C++ standard and in Appendix B of
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">The C++ Programming Language (3rd Edition)</a>),
C++ is a superset of C.
(Appendix B is available for downloading).
<p>
Please note that "C" in the paragraphs above refers to Classic C and C89.
C++ is not a descendant of C99; C++ and C99 are siblings.

<a name="difference">
</a><h2><a name="difference">What is the difference between C and C++?</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="difference">C++ is a direct descendant of C that retains almost all of C as a subset.
C++ provides stronger type checking than C and directly supports a wider
range of programming styles than C.
C++ is "a better C" in the sense that it supports the styles of programming
done using C with better type checking and more notational support (without
loss of efficiency).
In the same sense, ANSI C is a better C than K&amp;R C.
In addition, C++ supports data abstraction, object-oriented programming,
and generic programming
(see </a><a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">The C++ Programming Language (3rd Edition)"</a>;
Appendix B discussing compatibility issues is available for downloading).
</p><p>
I have never seen a program that could be expressed better in C than in C++
(and I don't think such a program could exist - every construct in C has an
obvious C++ equivalent).
However, there still exist a few environments where the support for C++
is so weak that there is an advantage to using C instead.
There aren't all that many of those left, though; see
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/compilers.html">my (incomplete) compilers list</a>.

<h2><a name="merge">
Do you really think that C and C++ could be merged into a single language?</a></h2>
I think that it would be a very good thing for the C/C++ community if they
were. That is, if the C/C++ incompatibilities were systematically and
completely eliminated and that future evolution was organized so as to
prevent new incompatibilities from emerging.
Whether that's possible is another matter.
<p>
My basic point is that the current C/C++ incompatibilities are "accidents of
history" that have no fundamental reasons behind them (though they all
"looked like a good idea at the time" to some competent and well-meaning
people).
The C/C++ incompatibilities provide no benefits to the community at large,
cause serious problems to a large section of the C/C++ community,
and could - with great difficulty - be eliminated.

I imagine that if incompatibilities were eliminated (by making changes to
both C and C++), there would still be entities called C and C++, but then
<a href="#C-is-subset">C really would be defined as a subset of C++</a>.
<p>
Please note that these papers were written in late 2001 and early 2002 when it was still possible
to imagine coordinated action by the C and C++ standards committees leading to practical results by
the end of the decade. This didn't happen.

<h2><a name="whyC">
Why did you make C++ (almost) compatible with C?</a></h2>
I wanted C++ to be compatible with a complete language with sufficient performance and
flexibility for even the most demanding systems programming.
I had a perfect dread of producing yet-another pretty language with unintentional limitations.
See Section 2.7 of 
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/dne.html">The Design and Evolution of C++</a>
for historical details and read the articles in
<a href="#merge">Do you really think ...?</a>
for a (retrospective) technical discussion of C/C++ compatibility issues.
<p>
At the time, I considered C the best systems programming language available.
That was not as obvious then (1979) as it later became,
but I had experts such as
<a href="http://netlib.bell-labs.com/who/dmr">Dennis Ritchie</a>,
Steve Johnson,
<a href="http://www.fraserresearch.org/agf.html">Sandy Fraser</a>,
Greg Chesson,
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Edoug">Doug McIlroy</a>, and
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Ebwk/">Brian Kernighan</a>
down the corridor from whom I could learn and get feedback.
Without their help and advice, and without C, C++ would have been stillborn.
</p><p>
Contrary to repeated rumors,
I was never told that I had to use C; nor was I ever told not to use C.
In fact, the first C++ manual grew from troff source of the C manual that Dennis gave me.
Many new languages were designed at Bell labs; in "Research" at least, there were no
rules enforcing language bigotry.

</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="C-slash">
What do you think of C/C++?</a></h2>
No that's not really a question I often get. In that sense, it is the 
only "fake FAQ" in this FAQ. However, it ought to be a FAQ because people 
use "C/C++" as if it meant something specific and as if they knew what 
it meant, leading to much confusion and misery. People should ask "What 
is C/C++?" and then on reflection stop using the term. It does harm.
<p>
There is no language called "C/C++".
The phrase is usually used by people who don't
have a clue about programming (e.g. HR personnel and poor managers).
Alternatively, it's used by people who simple do not know C++ (and often not C either).
When used by programmers,
it typically indicates a "C++ is C with a few useful and a lot of useless complicated features added"
attitude.
Often, that is the point of view of people who like to write their own strings and hash tables with
little knowledge of the standard library beyond printf and memcpy. 
There are people who stick to a restricted subset of C++ for perfectly good reasons,
but they (as far as I have noticed) are not the people who say "C/C++".
</p><p>
I use C/C++ only in phrases such as "C/C++ compatibility" and "C/C++ community". 
</p><p>

</p><hr>
<h2><a name="invention">
When was C++ invented?</a></h2>
I started work on what became C++ in 1979.
The initial version was called "C with Classes".
The first version of C++ was used internally in AT&amp;T in August 1983.
The name "C++" was used late that year.
The first commercial implementation was released October 1985 at the same time
as the publication of
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/1st.html">the 1st edition of The C++ Programming Language</a>.
Templates and exception handling were included later in the 1980's
and documented in 
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/arm.html">The Annotated C++ Reference Manual</a>
and
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/2nd.html">The C++ Programming Language (2rd Edition)</a>.
<p>
The current definition of C++ is

<h2><a name="why">
Why did you invent C++?</a></h2>
I wanted to write efficient systems programs in the styles encouraged by
Simula67.
To do that, I added facilities for better type checking, data abstraction,
and object-oriented programming to C.
The more general aim was to design a language in which I could write programs
that were both efficient and elegant.
Many languages force you to choose between those two alternatives.
<p>
The specific tasks that caused me to start designing and implementing C++
(initially called "C with Classes") had to do with distributing
operating system facilities across a network.

<h2><a name="why-ATT">
Why did AT&amp;T support the development of C++?</a></h2>
When I first developed C++, AT&amp;T built systems of greater complexity and with greater reliability
requirements than most organizations.
Consequently, we had to influence the market
and help set standards that meet our needs - or else we wouldn't have the
tools to build our systems. Left to itself "the industry" will create
languages and tools for dealing with "average" problems. Similarly,
teachers tend to focus on languages and tools that serve students and
researchers well - even if they don't scale to the most demanding tasks.
<p>
At the time when I developed C++ - and before that when Ken Thompson and
Dennis Ritchie developed Unix and C - AT&amp;T was probably the worlds largest
civilian user of (and consumer of) software tools. Then, we probably used
a wider
range of systems - from the tiniest embedded processors to the largest
supercomputers and data-processing systems. That put a premium on systems
that were applicable in many technical cultures and on many platforms.
C and C++ were designed with such demands in mind.
</p><p>
Thus generality is essential, and proprietary features are seen as limiting
the choice of platforms and vendors. As a consequence AT&amp;T was and is a major
supporter of formal standards (for example, ISO C and ISO C++).
</p><p>
Actually, AT&amp;T made enough money on Cfront, my original C++ compiler,
to pay for the development of C++ several times over.
</p><p>



</p><hr>
<h2><a name="revenues">
Do you own C++?</a></h2>
No. If anyone "owns C++," it must be the ISO. AT&amp;T gave the rights to the
C++ manual that I wrote to the ISO.
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/iso_pressrelease2.html">The ISO C++ Standard</a>
is copyrighted by ISO.
<p>
Compiler vendors do not pay royalties to me or to AT&amp;T for C++, and ISO
standards are specifications intended for royalty-free use by everyone
(once they have paid the ISO or a national standard committee for their
copy of the standard).
The individual compilers are owned by their respective vendors/suppliers.
</p><p>
"But someone from SCO claimed that they own C++"; is that not so? It's complete rubbish.
I saw that interview. The SCO guy clearly had no clue what C++ was, referring to it as
"the C++ languages".
At most, SCO may own a 15-year old and seriously outdated version of Cfront - my original
C++ compiler. I was careful not to patent or trademark anything to do with C++. That's one
reason we write plain "C++" and not "C++(tm)".
The C++ standard is unencumbered of patents - the committee carefully checked that also.

``I picked C++ because it was short, had nice interpretations, and wasn't of
the form "adjective C."'
In C, ++ can, depending on context, be read as "next," "successor," or 
"increment," though it is always pronounced "plus plus."
The name C++ and its runner up ++C are fertile sources for jokes and puns
-- almost all of which were known and appreciated before the name was chosen.
The name C++ was suggested by Rick Mascitti.
It was first used in December of 1983 when it was edited into the final
copies of [Stroustrup,1984] and [Stroustrup,1984c].
<p>
Chapter 1 of
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">TC++PL</a>:
``The name C++ (pronounced "see plus plus") was coined by Rick Mascitti in the summer of 1983.
The name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C; "++" is the C increment
operator. The slightly shorter name "C+" is a syntax error; it has also been 
used as the name of an
unrelated language. Connoisseurs of C semantics find C++ inferior to ++C. The 
language is not
called D, because it is an extension of C, and it does not attempt to remedy 
problems by removing
features. For yet another interpretation of the name C++, see the appendix of [Orwell,1949].''
</p><p>
The "C" in C++ has a long history.
Naturally, it is the name of the language Dennis Ritchie designed.
C's immediate ancestor was an interpreted descendant
of BCPL called B designed by Ken Thompson.
BCPL was designed and implemented by Martin Richards from Cambridge University
while visiting MIT in the other Cambridge.
BCPL in turn was Basic CPL, where CPL is the name of a rather large (for its time)
and elegant programming language developed jointly by the universities of
Cambridge and London.
Before the London people joined the project "C" stood for Cambridge.
Later, "C" officially stood for Combined.
Unofficially,
"C" stood for Christopher because Christopher Strachey was the main power 
behind CPL.''

<h2><a name="bootstrapping">
Which language did you use to write C++?</a></h2>
The first C++ compiler (Cfront) was written in C++.
To build that, I first used C to write a "C with Classes"-to-C preprocessor.
"C with Classes" was a C dialect that became the immediate ancestor to C++.
That preprocessor translated "C with Classes" constructs (such as classes
and constructors) into C.
It was a traditional preprocessor that didn't understand all of the
language, left most of the type checking for the C compiler to do,
and translated individual
constructs without complete knowledge. 
I then wrote the first version of Cfront in "C with Classes".
<p>
Cfront was a traditional compiler that did complete syntax and semantic
checking of the C++ source.
For that, it had a complete parser, built symbol tables, and built a complete
internal tree representation of each class, function, etc.
It also did some source level optimization on its internal tree representation
of C++ constructs before outputting C.
The version that generated C, did not rely on C for any type checking.
It simply used C as an assembler.
The resulting code was uncompromisingly fast.

<h2><a name="garbage-collection">
Why doesn't C++ have garbage collection?</a></h2>
If you want automatic garbage collection, there are good commercial and
public-domain garbage collectors for C++.
For applications where garbage collection is suitable, C++ is an
excellent
garbage collected language with a performance that compares favorably
with
other garbage collected languages.
See <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">The C++ Programming Language (3rd Edition)</a>
for
a discussion of automatic garbage collection in C++.
See also, Hans-J. Boehm's
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc">site for C and C++ garbage collection</a>.
<p>
Also, C++ supports programming techniques that allows memory management to
be <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/bs_faq2.html#memory-leaks">safe and implicit without a garbage collector</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++0xFAQ.html">C++0x</a> offers a GC ABI.

</p><hr>
<h2><a name="gui">
Why doesn't C++ have a GUI?</a></h2>
C++ has many commercial and open source GUIs (e.g.
<a href="http://gtkmm.sourceforge.net/">Gtkmm</a>,
<a href="http://smartwin.sourceforge.net/">SmartWin++</a>,
<a href="http://www.objectcentral.com/">V C++ GUI</a>,
<a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a>, and
<a href="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt</a>).
In particular, every platform vendor provides a C++ library to access their GUI.
The problem is that it doesn't have a standard GUI, and that is indeed a major problem.
<p>
Note that providing a GUI is both a technical and political problem.
There are lots of GUIs with lots of users, and generally they wouldn't like some other
GUI to be declared standard.
Anyway, the standards committee do not have the resources to build a new and better GUI.
</p><p>


</p><hr>
<h2><a name="threads">
Why doesn't C++ support threads?</a></h2>
The ISO C++ standard doesn't mention concurrency, but all major C++ implementations support threads;
pthreads runs essentially everywhere and many platform vendors support their own system threads.
For portability, use some threads library, such as Boost threads.
<p>
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++0xFAQ.html">C++0x</a> offers threads.
</p><p>


</p><hr>
<h2><a name="decline">
Is C++ in decline?</a></h2>
No, I don't think so.
C++ use appears to be declining in some areas and to be on an upswing in others.
If I had to guess, I'd suspect a net decrease sometime during 2002-2004 and a net 
increase in 2005-2007, but I doubt anyone really knows. Most of the 
popular measures basically measures noise and ought to report their 
findings in decibel rather than "popularity." Many of the major uses of C++ are 
in infrastructure (telecommunications, banking, embedded systems, etc.) 
where programmers don't go to conferences or describe their code in 
public. Many of the most interesting and important C++ applications are 
not noticed, they are not for sale to the public as programming 
products, and their implementation language is never mentioned. Examples 
are Google and "800" phone numbers. Had I thought of a "C++ inside" logo 
in 1985, the programming world might have been different today.
<p>
One simple thing that confuses many discussions of language 
use/popularity is the distinction between relative and absolute 
measures. For example, I say that C++ use is growing when I see user 
population grow by 200,000 programmers from 3.1M to 3.3M. However, 
somebody else may claim that "C++ is dying" because it's "popularity" 
has dropped from 16 percent to 11 percent of the total number of programmers. 
Both claims could be simultaneously true as the number of programmers 
continues to grow and especially as what is considered to be programming 
continues to change. I think that C++ is more than holding its own in 
its traditional core domains, such as infrastructure, systems 
programming, embedded systems, and applications with serious time and/or 
space constraints.

<h2><a name="improve">
What's being done to improve C++?</a></h2>
Implementers are continually improving their <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/compilers.html">compilers</a>,
libraries, and tools.
The last five years have seen very significant improvements in quality.
This is what most directly and most immediatly helps people;
that, and the host of proprietary and open source libraries and tools that are continuosly
being produced by the C++ community. See <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++.html">my C++ page</a> for examples.
<p>
The <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++.html">ISO C++ standard</a> was ratified in 1998.
The next version, nicknamed <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++0xFAQ.html">C++0x</a>,
is complete  and in public review; after that comes a "proofeading pass,"
and a ratification process.
You can find papers describing C++0x on <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/papers.html">my publications page</a>
and all documents relating to the new standard on
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21">the ISO C++ committee's home pages</a>.
My <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/hopl-almost-final.pdf">HOPL-iii paper</a> on the last 15 years of C++ evolution
may the best explanation of what is being done and why.
A <a href="http://www.devx.com/SpecialReports/Article/38813/0/page/1">recent interview</a>
contains lists of new language features and standard libraries.
</p><p>
When considering the evolution of C++, it is worth remembering that the aim is not to add the largest
number of new features, but to improve C++ for its key application domains, including systems
programming and library building, without breaking older code
(there are billions of lines of C++ "out there").

<h2><a name="Hello-world">
Why is the code generated for the "Hello world" program ten times larger for C++
than for C?</a></h2>
It isn't on my machine, and it shouldn't be on yours.
I have even seen the C++ version of the "hello world"
program smaller than the C version.
In 2004, I tested using gcc -o2 on a Unix and
the two versions (iostreams and stdio) yielded identical sizes.
There is no language reason why the one version should be larger than
the other. It is all an issue on how an implementor organizes the
standard libraries (e.g. static linking vs. dynamic linking,
locale support by default vs. locale support enabled through and option, etc.).
If one version is significantly larger than the other,
report the problem to the implementor of the larger.


<p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="advanced">
How can a legacy language like C++ compete with modern, advanced languages?</a></h2>
Naturally, calling C++ a legacy language shows a bias (see
<a href="#legacy">legacy code</a>).
That aside, people are usually thinking of
<a href="#Java">Java</a> or <a href="#Csharp">C#</a> when they ask such a
question.
I will not <a href="#compare">compare C++ to those languages</a>, but I can
point out that "modern" doesn't necessarily mean "better", and that both
Java and C# are rooted in 1980s style OOP to an even greater extent than
early C++ is.
<p>
Since 1987 or so, the focus of development the C++ language and its associated
programming styles have been the use
of templates, static polymorphism, generic programming, and multiparadigm
programming. This is way beyond the scope of the much-hyped proprietary
languages. Another key difference is that C++ supports user-defined types
to the same extent as built-in types. This - especially in
combination with the use of templates, constructors, and destructors -
enables the C++ programmer to use
programming and design techniques that (IMO) are more advanced than what is
supported in the languages with which C++ is most often compared; e.g. see
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/bs_faq2.html#finally">RTTI</a>.
</p><p>
Standard C++ and the design and programming styles it supports owe a debt
to the functional languages, especially to ML.
Early variants of ML's type deduction mechanisms were (together with much
else) part of the inspiration
of templates. Some of the more effective functional programming
techniques were part of the inspiration of the STL and the use of function
objects in C++.
On the other hand, the functional community missed the boat with
object-oriented programming, and few of the languages and tools from that
community benefited from the maturing experience of large-scale industrial
use.
</p><p>
Clearly, I don't think that
<a href="#garbage-collection">garbage collection</a> is the sole defining
characteristic of "advanced" in the context of programming languages.
In particular, note that C++ provides support for effective and efficient
memory management techniques that can eliminate resource leaks without the
use of a garbage collector.
If you disagree, you can just start using a garbage collector for C++;
there are good ones available.



</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="multiparadigm">
What is "multiparadigm programming"?</a></h2>
Multiparadigm programming is a fancy way of saying "programming using more
than one programming style, each to its best effect."
For example, using object-oriented programming when run-time resolution
between different object types is required and generic programming when
static type safety and run-time performance is at a premium.
Naturally, the main strength of multiparadigm programming is in programs
where more than one paradigm
(programming style) is used, so that it would be hard to get the same effect
by composing a system out of parts written in languages supporting different paradigms.
I find the most compelling cases for multiparadigm programming are found where
techniques from different paradigms are used in close collaboration to
write code that is more elegant and more maintainable than would be possible
within a single paradigm.
A simple example is the traversal of a statically typed container of objects
of a polymorphic type:
<pre>	void draw_all(vector&lt; Shape*&gt;&amp; vs)	// draw each element of a standard vector
	{
		for_each(vs.begin(),vs.end(),mem_fun(&amp;Shape::draw));
	}
</pre>
Here, Shape will be an abstract base class defining the interface to
a hierarchy of geometric shapes.
This example easily generalizes to any standard library container:
<pre>	template&lt; class C&gt; void draw_all(C&amp; cs)	// draw each element of a standard container
	{
		for_each(cs.begin(),cs.end(),mem_fun(&amp;Shape::draw));
	}
</pre>
<p>
Jim Coplien's book "Multiparadigm Design for C++" (Addison Wesley, 1998)
explores the use of multiple paradigms in the context of design
and design methods. 
</p><p>



</p><hr>
<h2><a name="big">
Why is C++ so BIG?</a></h2>
C++ isn't as big as some people imagine.
It's not a tiny language designed to be a minimal language for teaching,
but neither are the languages people most often compare it to, such as C, Java, C#.
They too are huge compared to say, Pascal as Dr. Wirth originally defined it
- for good reasons, I think.
The programming world is far more complex today than it was 30 years ago,
and modern programming languages reflect that.
<p>
The C++ standard is 740 pages, but that includes 400 pages of library description.
The language features are described (in excruciating detail) in 340 pages. Similarly,
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/3rd.html">TC++PL</a> is 1000+ pages, but only 350 of those are devoted to the explanation
of language facilities and their use; the rest discuss libraries, programming techniques, etc.
</p><p>
C++ directly supports (i.e., in the language) what some other languages support through libraries,
so the language part will be relatively larger. On the other hand, if you want to write
a "typical modern application", you need to consider operating system interfaces, GUI,
databases, web interfaces, etc. the sum of language features, libraries, and programming
conventions and standards that you must become familiar with dwarf the programming language.
Here, C++'s size can be an advantage as far as it better supports good libraries.
</p><p>
Finally, the days where a novice programmer can know all of a language are gone, at least for the
languages in widespread industrial use. Few people know "all of C" or "all of Java" either and none
of those are novices. It follows that nobody should have to apologize for the fact that
novices do not know all of C++. What you must do - in any language - is to pick a subset,
get working writing code, and gradually learn more of the language, its libraries, and its tools.
For my suggestion on how beginners can approach C++, see

<h2><a name="EC++">
What do you think of EC++?</a></h2>
EC++ is an (almost) subset of C++ lacking exceptions, templates,
namespaces,
RTTI support, multiple inheritance, etc. being defined by an "industry
consortium."
I am not in favor of language subsets or dialects.
I am especially not fond of subsets that cannot support the standard
library so
that the users of that subset must invent their own incompatible
foundation libraries.
I fear that a defined subset of C++ could split the user community and
cause acrimony (3/31/1999: I just saw an advertisement that used vivid
graphics to indicate how EC++ reduced "fat" (i.e. memory space) by abolishing
- among other things - namespaces, templates, and C++ standard strings. Sigh!).
I strongly prefer work on "standards" to occur in an open forum (such
as ISO or a national standards organization).
<p>
For a discussion of how embedded systems implementers can
address performance issues using Standard C++ (better than by using dialects)
see the ISO C++ committee's <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/performanceTR.pdf">report on performance</a>.
To the best of my knowledge EC++ is dead (2004), and if it isn't it ought to be.

<h2><a name="from-Smalltalk">
C++ got its Object-Oriented concepts from Smalltalk?</a></h2>
No. C++ got the key notions of classes, derived classes, virtual
functions
(in other words, the notions of encapsulation, inheritance and
polymorphism)
from Simula just like Smalltalk did.
In terms of family relationships, C++ and Smalltalk are siblings.
<p>


</p><hr>
<h2><a name="Object-Oriented-language">
Is C++ an Object-Oriented language?</a></h2>
C++ is a
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/bs_faq.html#multiparadigm">multi-paradigm programming language</a>
that supports Object-Oriented and other useful styles of programming.
If what you are looking for is something that forces you to do things
in
exactly one way, C++ isn't it.
There is no one right way to write every program - and even if there
were
there would be no way of forcing programmers to use it.
<p>
That said, writing C-style programs in C++ is for most applications not
an
optimal use of C++. To be a really effective C++ programmer, you must
use
the abstraction mechanisms and the type system in a way that fits
reasonably
with their intent. Trying to ignore or defeat the C++ type system is a
most frustrating experience.
</p><p>
Writing Java-style code in C++ can be as frustrating and
sub-optimal as
writing C-style code in C++.

<h2><a name="really-say-that">
Did you really say that?</a></h2>
<i>"C makes it easy to shoot yourself
in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole
leg off"</i>.
Yes, I said something like that (in 1986 or so).
What people tend to miss, is that what I said there about C++ is to
a varying
extent true for all powerful languages. As you protect people from
simple
dangers, they get themselves into new and less obvious problems.
Someone who avoids the simple problems may simply be heading for
a not-so-simple one. One problem with very supporting and protective
environments is that the hard problems may be discovered too late or
be too hard to remedy once discovered.
Also, a rare problem is harder to find than a frequent one
because you don't suspect it.
<p>
<i>"Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language
struggling to get out"</i>.
Yes, that quote can be found on page 207 of
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/dne.html">The Design and Evolution of C++</a>.
And no, that smaller and cleaner language is not
<a href="#Java">Java</a>
or
<a href="#Csharp">C#</a>.
The quote occurs in a section entitled "Beyond Files and Syntax".
I was pointing out that the C++ semantics is much cleaner than its syntax.
I was thinking of programming styles, libraries and programming environments
that emphasized the cleaner and more effective practices over archaic uses
focused on the low-level aspects of C.
</p><p>
<i>"I have always wished for my computer to be as easy
to use as my telephone; my wish has come true because I can no longer figure out
how to use my telephone"</i>.
I said that after a frustrating attempt to use a "feature-rich" telephone
sometime around 1990. I'm sure the sentiment wasn't original, and probably not
even the overall phrasing; someone must have thought of that before me.
</p><p>
<i>"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about
and the ones nobody uses"</i>.
Yes.
Again, I very much doubt that the sentiment is original. Of course, all "there are only two" quotes
have to be taken with a grain of salt.
</p><p>
<i>"Proof by analogy is fraud"</i>.
Yes; page 692 of TC++PL.
A good analogy is an excellent way of illustrating
an idea, but far too often such analogies are not accompanied by solid reasoning, data, etc.
</p><p>
<i>"People who think they know everything really annoy those of us who know we don't"</i>.
Yes.
</p><p>
<i>"C++ Is my favorite garbage collected language because it generates so little garbage"</i>.
Yes; see <a href="#garbage-collection">Why doesn't C++ have garbage collection?</a> and
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/bs_faq2.html#memory-leaks">How do I deal with memory leaks</a>.
</p><p>
<i>"If you think it's simple, then you have misunderstood the problem"</i>.
Yes, but no, I don't recall which question elicited that answer.
</p><p>
<i>"There are more useful systems developed in languages deemed 
awful than in languages praised for being beautiful--many more"</i>.
Yes, in <a href="http://technologyreview.com/InfoTech/17831">MIT Technology Review interview</a>
and elsewhere.
There, I also said:
</p><ul>
<li>
<i>"I think we should look for elegance in the applications built,
      rather than in the languages themselves"</i>.
	I should have said "more than" rather than "rather than".
</li><li>
<i>"To use C++ well, you have to understand design and programming technique"</i>.
</li><li>
<i>"C++ is designed to allow you to express ideas, but if you don't
      have ideas or don't have any clue about how to express them, C++
      doesn't offer much help"</i>.
</li></ul>
<p>
<i>Far too often, "computer science" is a form of math envy</i>.
Yes, but 
please don't forget that "Far too often." The quote comes from a context 
where I'm worrying about insufficient attention to data (empiricism) and 
insufficient attention to the connection to computing. It is not a 
frontal assault on the notion that computer science can be science 
(e.g., see Knuth on algorithms and the analysis of algorithms; that's 
science and it is not any other science). And, no, I'm not going to give 
concrete examples or names.
</p><p>
<i>Far too often, "software engineering" is neither engineering nor about 
software</i>.
Yes, but please don't forget that "Far too often." The quote 
comes from a context where I'm worrying about insufficient attention to 
data (empiricism) and insufficient attention to the connection to code. 
I'm worried that the realities of having to deliver useful and 
maintainable code can be drowned in processes, corporate standards, and 
marketing studies; that software development sometimes is controlled by 
people who couldn't recognize good code if it jumped up and punched them 
on the nose, and are proud of that. And, no, I'm not going to give 
concrete examples or names. When practiced well, software development is 
a worthy engineering discipline, delivering results that compares well 
with those of older engineering disciplines.
</p><p>
<i>When (not if) automatic garbage collection becomes part of C++, it will be optional</i>.
Yes in a

</p><p>
<i>It's easy to win forgiveness for being wrong; being right is what gets you into real trouble.</i>
Yes.
</p><p>
<i>Any problem in computer science can be solved with another layer of indirection</i>, known as the 1st law of computing.
Yes, I said that quoting (my PhD Thesis advison) David J. Wheeler. Please don't misattribute it to me.

<h2><a name="legacy">
What is "legacy code"?</a></h2>
"Legacy code" is a term often used derogatorily to characterize code that
is written in a language or style that
(1) the speaker/writer consider outdated
and/or
(2) is competing with something sold/promoted by the speaker/writer.
"Legacy code" often differs from its suggested alternative by actually
working and scaling.

<h2><a name="number-of-C++-users">
Is the number of C++ users still doubling every year?</a></h2>
No. During 1980-1991, the number of users doubled every seven
and a half months (see
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/dne.html"> The Design and Evolution of C++</a>).
However, there simply aren't enough programmers to sustain that.
From the few numbers I can get (compiler sales, book sales, workloads of
consultants I happen to know, IDC, etc.), I estimate that the growth rate is
a few percent.
<a href="#decline">Steady and definitely positive</a>.
IDC estimated that 1.2 million C++ Implementations were sold in 1996.
Their 2001 estimate of the number of C++ programmers was "about 3 million";
their 2004 number was "more than 3 million".
That seems plausible and indicates a continued growth.

<p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="use-C++">
Does anyone use C++ these days?</a></h2>
Yes, <a href="#number-of-C++-users">many</a> do. There are too many C++ users

C++ is supported by all <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/compilers.html">major vendors</a>.

</p><hr>
<h2><a name="C++success">
Did you expect C++ to become such a success?</a></h2>
Of course not.
The success rate for general-purpose programming languages is vanishingly small.
I knew that, and I knew that the chance of success was affected by marketing
clout, which I did not have.
<p>
C++ was initially designed and implemented as a set of general
facilities addressing some specific problems that I and my colleagues faced.
The generality - and efficiency - of the facilities provided turned out to
serve much wider needs than I had anticipated.
The emphasis on general facilities - as opposed to the provision of specific
solutions to specific problems - has remained with C++ and has served its
community well as the specific problems facing the community have changed
over the years.

<h2><a name="certification">
What's a good certification for C++ programmers?</a></h2>
To the best of my knowledge, there isn't a good certification program for C++ programmers.
That's a pity. A <i>good</i> certification program would be most useful.
However, C++ lacks the central organization that would produce a solid certification program, and
a certification program without authority or that focused on syntax would be worse than useless.

<h2><a name="working-on-now">What are you working on now?</a></h2>
A better FAQ :-)
<p>
Seriously, I'm looking for
fundamental ways of improving the tools and techniques we use to build
large real-world systems.
One part of my work is <a href="#When-next-standard">C++0x</a>.

<h2><a name="what-is">
What is C++?</a></h2>
C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias towards 
systems programming that
<ul>
<li>is <a href="#difference">a better C</a>
</li><li>supports <a href="#class">data abstraction</a>
</li><li>supports <a href="#oop">object-oriented programming</a>
</li><li>supports <a href="#generic">generic programming</a>
</li></ul>

It is defined by
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++.html">an ISO standard</a>,
offers stability over decades,
and has a large and lively user community.

<h2><a name="background">
Where can I learn about the background of C++?</a></h2>
About the design of C++? About the history of C++?
<p>
Look at my papers for
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/hopl2.pdf">HOPL-2</a> and
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/hopl-almost-final.pdf">HOPL-3</a>;
HOPL stands for "History Of Programming Languages", the premier 
conference on that subject, sponsored by the ACM. These are heavily 
peer-reviewed papers.
For even more information see my book

<h2><a name="true">
Is it true that ...?</a></h2>
Many questions come to me in the form of assertions
<ul>
<li>C++ is low-level(?)
</li><li>C++ too slow for low-level work(?)
</li><li>C++ is useful only if you write truly object-oriented code(?)
</li><li>Modern C++ is all generic programming and template metaprogramming(?)
</li><li>C++ is designed by Microsoft(?)
</li></ul>

Often, the person bringing up one of these points considers the 
statement a fact (but none of these assertions are true);
sometimes, there is an implied question mark. So,
<ul>

<li><i>C++ is low-level?</i>
No. C++ offers both low-level and high-level features.
C++ has low-level parts, such as pointers, arrays, and casts.
These facilities are
(<a href="#difference">almost identical to what C offers</a>)
are essential (in some form or other) for close-to-the-hardware work.
So, if you want low-level language facilities, yes C++ provides a 
well-tried set of facilities for you.
However, when you don't want to use low-level features, you don't need 
to use the C++ facilities (directly). Instead, you can rely on 
higher-level facilities, including libraries.
For example, if you don't want to use arrays and pointers, standard 
library strings and containers are (better) alternatives in many cases.
If you use only low-level facilities, you are almost certainly wasting 
time and complicating maintenance without performance advantages
(see <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/new_learning.pdf"> Learning Standard C++ as a New Language</a>).
You may also be laying your systems open to attacks (e.g. buffer overflows).

</li><li><i>C++ too slow for low-level work?</i>
No. If you can afford to use C, you can afford to use C++, even the 
higher-level facilities of C++ where you need their functionality.
See
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/abstraction-and-machine.pdf">Abstraction and the C++ machine model</a>
and the ISO C++ standards committee's
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/performanceTR.pdf">Technical Report on Performance</a>.

</li><li><i>C++ is useful only if you write truly object-oriented code?</i>
No.
That is, "no" for just about any reasonable definition of "object-oriented".
C++ provides support for a wide variety of needs, not just for one style 
or for one kind of application.
In fact, compared to C, C++ provides more support for very simple programming tasks.
For example, the standard library and other libraries radically 
simplifies many otherwise tedious and error-prone tasks.
C++ is widely used for huge
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/applications.html">applications</a>
but it also provides benefits for even tiny programming tasks.

</li><li><i>Modern C++ is all generic programming and template metaprogramming?</i>
No.
C++ supports
<a href="#multiparadigm">several useful programming techniques</a>, 
including, traditional procedural programming, object-oriented 
programming, and generic programming.
None of these is better than all others for all uses and typically the 
most effective solution to a real-world problem involves a combination 
of techniques.

</li><li><i>C++ is designed by Microsoft?</i>
No.
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/href=" hopl2.pdf="">I originally designed and implemented C++</a> and
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/hopl-almost-final.pdf">together with the ISO C++ standards committee refined its definition</a>.
Microsoft has taken an active and largely positive role in this standardization
- as has Apple, GNU, IBM, Sun, and many others.
Like others - e.g. Apple - Microsoft tries to help/lock-in their users with proprietary extensions,
(in particular, <a href="#CppCLI">Microsoft C++/CLI</a>).

<h2><a name="boost">
What do you think of Boost?</a></h2>
<a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> is a large and expanding
<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs">collection of libraries</a>
designed to work well with the ISO C++ standard library.
It contains many extremely useful and well-engineered libraries, such as asio, filesystem, 
regex, and thread (apologies for not trying to identify more useful 
libraries; there are just too many).
One library, TR1, contains a good approximation of new C++0x standard 
library components.
<p>
The Boost libraries have tests suites, have documentation, have been tested on multiple systems,
and are peer reviewed.
</p><p>
I have two problems with Boost, though, which I hope will be dealt with eventually:
</p><ul>
<li>It is too hard to download and use just one Boost library; the 
libraries seem overly coupled making it hard to pick and choose.
</li><li>Some of the libraries are too clever for my taste. Sometimes, 
generality and simplicity coincide; in Boost, the balance is IMO too 
often so far towards generality that novices and average users are lost.
</li></ul>
That said, it is usually a really dumb idea to go and reinvent a wheel 
that boost already offers.

<h2><a name="metaprogramming">
What do you think of template metaprogramming?</a></h2>
Template metaprogramming is a set of powerful programming techniques, 
which when used with care and taste can help solve quite tricky problems, mostly 
relating to the architecture of larger systems, their portability, and 
their maintenance (see Abrahams and Gurtovoy:
<a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321227255">C++ Template Metaprogramming</a> and some of
<a href="http://www.boost.org/">the Boost libraries</a>.
<p>
Like all powerful techniques they are easily overused. Personally, I 
tend to use templates primarily for generic programming (e.g., defining 
containers and algorithms over containers) and for templates that 
generate fairly obvious code based on template arguments (e.g., 
generating buffers and register access code); that's sometimes called 
generative programming. Be careful about the complexity of the templates 
you write or use; it is easy to get overenthusiastic and write template 
code that is too clever to be useful as maintainable production code.
</p><p>
If you do not like functional programming styles, you might find 
template metaprograms hard to understand. If you do like functional 
programming, you may find the template version a bit primitive, but 
remember these templates are executed at compile-time.
